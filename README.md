__Admin panel__


Admin panel is actually an login window for an organisation in which local user or
administrator user can access the data or any information regarding that organisation.
In our login window I had given access to both local as well as administrator user ,
but they need enter there user I'd and password for such , and that access will be 
recorded means who saw the information of the member of organisation to avoid the misuse
of such information. One more feature of the admin panel is that there is limited access 
for the user, means a local user can access limited no of times per month and the 
administrator user has more access limit But this access limit can be increased by the 
requesting and giving a valid reason for the access .
